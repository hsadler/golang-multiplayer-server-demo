    - POC Unity game client conformint to updated game server API
    - stub out Unity game client architecture
    - implement players joining game, seeing each other's movement
    - implement food spawning, consumption, and player size increase
    - implement player eat player and player respawn
    - implement time per round and game reset
    - implement winning player and other player ranking


/////////// GAME UX ///////////

1. player enters name to join active game
2. players eat food go grow bigger
3. bigger players can eat smaller players
4. players who are eaten respawn
5. players need to avoid mines which cause damage and therefor size decrease
6. each round has a time limit
7. at the end of each round, winner is declared and player's rank is displayed
