/////////// GAME UX ///////////

1. player enters name to join active game
2. players eat food go grow bigger
3. bigger players can eat smaller players
4. players who are eaten respawn
5. players need to avoid mines which cause damage and therefor size decrease
6. each round has a time limit
7. at the end of each round, winner is declared and player's rank is displayed
